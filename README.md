## 👩‍💼 Who Am I?

I’m a Full Stack Software Developer with a Master’s in Computer and Information Science from NJIT. I specialize in building robust, cloud-native applications using Python, Django, React, and PostgreSQL. Experience in designing, developing, and deploying scalable backend systems, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.

- 🌱 Currently exploring: **Kafka**, **Generative AI**, and **Kubernetes**
- 💬 Ask me about: **Backend Development**, **RESTful APIs**, **Cloud Architecture**, **AI Integrations**, and **Vector DBs**

## 💡 What Motivates Me?

From the early days of writing simple scripts to now designing intelligent systems with cloud-native architectures, my journey has always been driven by curiosity and impact.

What excites me the most is solving real-world problems—whether it’s optimizing backend performance, building microservices at scale, or integrating AI to make applications smarter and more intuitive. I’m especially drawn to projects that blend backend engineering with emerging technologies like **Generative AI**, **Kafka**, and **Vector Databases**—they offer endless potential to reimagine how systems learn, adapt, and respond.

I take pride in transforming complex challenges into clean, maintainable solutions. Whether it's deploying Docker containers on Kubernetes, building secure REST APIs, or designing scalable data flows in Kafka, I’m motivated by the idea that great code can drive meaningful impact.

What keeps me going?  
👉 Continuous learning, working with high-performing teams, and building tools that make people’s lives easier—even if it's behind the scenes.
